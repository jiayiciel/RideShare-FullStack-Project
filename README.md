Final Project: Your Own Web App!
Overview

Your goal is to create a database-backed web application which utilizes a RESTful API with the following constraints:

Your team may only consist of 4-5 people, with each person having a specific role.
Your project must be a web application that has a frontend, an API, JavaScript backend, and at least one database.
Your project needs to have user authentication.
Your project needs to have a heuristic evaluation with at least one revision. Make sure you plan time for this.
Your project must have a strong focus on design, primarily in user experience (UX), user interface (UI), and responsiveness.
Part A: Proposal

Due - Nov 8, 2017, 11.59PM CST

Fill out this short Google form with your team information

Upload a one-page PDF proposal to this Google drive folder containing the following:

Team Name
Team Members (Names and NetIDs)
Three Project Proposals with the following:
Problem Statement + Motivation
User problems you are solving
Basic interactions your app will support in service of goal
Other apps that are similar
How your app is different
There is no length requirement for the proposals, but they should cover all the information above.

Part B: Functional Prototypes

Due - November 27, 2017, In Class

During class, teams will perform heuristic evaluations of each other’s prototypes and give feedback.

Prototypes should capture at least three of the key interactions in your team’s web app. The prototypes can be done digitally (using software like powerpoint or balsamiq), but should be printed and brought to class. During class, the TAs will be walking around grading prototypes for quality and completion.

Part C: Final Presentation

Due - Dec 13, 2017, Before Class

On the final day of class, your overall deliverables are:

Source Code for the Project / URL to GitHub Repository
URL to your hosted project
No longer than 3-minute video detailing your web app’s purpose, design, and functionality
~~Peer evaluation~~
Final Project Competition @ Research Park

Everyone is invited to come to Research Park Atrium on December 13th (time TBD) to enjoy refreshments and watch presentations given by the top projects.

The address for Research Park is: 60 Hazelwood Dr, Champaign, IL 61820. To get to Research Park via CUMTD, follow this map.

Out of the final projects, the Course Staff will choose the best 10-13 projects to present at Research Park. The presentations will consist of 3 minutes for the video and 5 minutes for a Q&A session. Industry experts from Research Park will be present in order to judge your projects and ask questions.

The judges will then choose the best projects to receive awards (TBD).

Video Requirements

3-minutes length max
Should focus on design and functionality
Use screen capture software (SnagIt/ScreenFlow (Mac)/Camstasia/Quicktime)
Demo the important user flows
Voice-over should tell a concrete story: user, problem, and how your app solves it
Communicate the motivation behind design decisions (e.g. how did heuristic evaluation play a role in changes that were made to the interface?)
Grade Breakdown

proposal/prototypes (10%)
video (15%)
design (UX, UI, responsiveness, evaluation) (35%)
front end implementation (15%)
back end implementation (15%)
user authentication (10%)
